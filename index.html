        <h2>HEART EARRINGS</h2>
        <h3>05/10/2023</h3>
        <p>I made these earrings for a special teacher before my high school graduation. She had done a lot for me and
          my friends throughout highschool, so I wanted to gove her something special and personal, so I designed these
          based on her style. She loves to wear big jewelry, and so I felt that these were perfect. I gave her the blue
          pair, and also made a white pair for my mom since she liked the design as well. </p>

        <h2>VALENTINES BRACELETS</h2>
        <h3>02/14/2023</h3>
        <p>I was an executive for the an envionmental club in my high school, and created a bunch of valentines day
          themed bracelets to sell during a bake sale fundraiser for WWF. These were fun especially since I had to come
          up with multiple different types of designs along with a deadline. They all sold out, plus, I recieved many
          custom orders afterward!</p>

        <h2>CLOVER CHOKER</h2>
        <h3>05/19/2023</h3>
        <p>I made this choker necklace as a gift for my friend's birthday. This style of jewelry making, with the linked
          beads, is my favorite, and therapeutic to put together. I chose the beads based on her favorite colors and
          knowing that the shades and style would match her outfits as well.</p>

        <h2>BRAIDED RINGS</h2>
        <h3>06/05/2022</h3>
        <p>These braided rings were some of the first pieces of jewelry I made when I started practicing this hobby, and
          also became my most popular item sold through my small business. I've lost count of how many I've made, but
          i've improved each time, and love trying out different color combinations with gold and silver wire and
          different types of shades of beads.</p>

        <h2>PEACH PIT</h2>
        <h3>01/07/2024</h3>
        <p>After starting college, it's been tough to find time to journal, so I did as much as I could over winter
          break. I made this spread wanting to play with cutout letters I made, and based them off of song lyrics from a
          song I'd been listening to (Peach Pit by Peach Pit). I was also able to mix some things I collected both in
          college station and high school (ex. the receipt is from cstat and the scorpion logo is from my high school).

        <h2>PROM NIGHT</h2>
        <h3>07/03/2023</h3>
        <p>I made this spread based off of the photo which was taken at my prom. I love to create ramdom mix match
          spreads, but this time, I had a focused color palette and theme. I incorporated the ticket to the event and
          chose scotch tape that seemed on theme (it literally says Celebrate!).</p>

        <h2>INK DOODLES</h2>
        <h3>03/13/2023</h3>
        <p>I wanted to experiment with ink doodles and incorporate that into my journaling style, and included song
          lyrics from a song whose vibe I think matched the doodles (Windmill by McAfferty). It was fun challenging
          myself to come up with ways to fill the space and not being as minimalistic as I tended to be with my spreads
          before this!</p>

        <h2>LIGHT MY F(EYE)IRE</h2>
        <h3>02/28/2023</h3>
        <p>Something I tend to do with art sometimes is limit my pallette, but with this one, I wanted to play with my
          colors, and it was so much fun. I mixed numerous shades of colored pencils to draw the eyes, and continued the
          doodles and design around them. I incorporated song lyrics from one of my favorite songs from my favorite
          bands (Move Me by half•alive). </p>

        <h2>MY FAVORITE</h2>
        <h3>01/23/2023</h3>
        <p>Not only is this spread my personal favorite, but I also believe it matches my style and taste the most. It
          features stars and butterflies, some of my favorite elements, and a color theme that I love. I love including
          receipts and book pages as well, both of which are featured here. This was also one of the first times I
          wasn't afraid to just use the gluestick and see what happens, and I'm proud of how it turned out. I no longer
          hesitate with my art. </p>

        <h2>TWO FACED</h2>
        <h3>11/22/2022</h3>
        <p>For my photography class, this photo was taken to demonstrate what slow shutter speed can do, and to convery
          a dark and unsettling tone. It took many attempts, but I kept trying till I was satisfied. I put a green
          sticky note over my phone flashlight, and moved my head within 5 seconds. </p>

        <h3>12/08/2022</h3>
        <p>I was the media director for a couple of clubs in high school, so I got the ooportunity to take pictures at
          numerous events, pictures that I'd post on the club social media, and share with the magazine and yearbook
          teams for our school. This basketball fundraiser event was hosted by STUCO and as media director/photographer,
          I got to practice taking action shots. This one is my favorite, moments before a dunk!</p>

        <h2>ANGLES</h2>
        <h3>01/11/2024</h3>
        <p>I had my friends pose in front of a white sheet backdrop with newspapers arrounding them and pops of color
          through their lipstick. Color scheme, facial expression, and the angle at which the photo was taken were all
          considered to create an editorial style result. I first became interested in this portrait style when I came
          accross work by Michela Riva, who does odd fashion photography. I also applied to be a photographer for TAMU's
          Aline Magazine and gained inspiration from them as well.</p>

        <h2>DREW</h2>
        <h3>11/14/2022</h3>
        <p>I was provided an Adobe Photoshop subscription through my high school, and wanted to experiment with the
          application through what I'd learned in a graphic design class and my experience as a layout designer for my
          school's magazine. I just felt the urge to create something, so when I came accross a cool photoshoot throgh
          this actor's instagram account, and some ideas on Pinterest, I made this funky piece.</p>

        <p>Featured in this are some portraits taken by Michela Riva, my editorial/magazine photography inspiration. No
          longer having access to Photoshop, I utilized PicsArt to create this piece, going along with the magazine
          theme. Simply by using my phone, something I always have on me, I can explore my creative interests with
          designs like this, which I made in a bank waiting room.</p>

        <h2>TRIPPY</h2>
        <h3>08/15/2023</h3>
        <p>Like I did with my journal spreads, I told myself not to hesitate to just put things together when I made
          this piece. I wanted to do something creative with the trippy lines background, and of course, a little bit of
          myself with the cutout letters, something I love to use in my traditional journaling work.</p>
