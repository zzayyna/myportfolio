<h1>✰ ZAYNA SAYYED ✰</h1> <br>
  <p>Howdy! I'm Zayna, and I'm a Pakistani American, curretly a freshman at the College of Engineering at Texas A&M. I love stars, the fall season, and my favorite app is Pinterest. Before coming to Texas, I was living in Saudi Arabia for 10 years until I graduated high school. I'm interested in pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Graphic Design. I love testing my creative abilities, which is why I've been attending hackathons where I develop my UI/front end skills, and am part of the PR committee for the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) as a photographer. Any opportunity to build my skills excites me. You can also check out my jewelry business and a photograpy account I share with my friend through the links in the menu. When I'm not studying or practicing art, I'm either listening to music/organizing my spotify playlists, or eating chocolate chip cookies. I hope you enjoy my portfolio as much as I enjoyed creating and coding it! </p> <br><br><br>
